            <h2>What is Urban Forestry?</h2>
            <p>Urban forestry is the careful planning, planting, protection, and care of trees, forests, greenway connections and other natural resources in and around urban areas. It encompasses not just individual trees along streets or in parks, but entire ecosystems within city limits.</p>

            <h2>Challenges in Urban Forestry</h2>
            <p>Despite its many benefits, urban forestry faces several obstacles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Limited space in densely populated areas</li>
                <li>Soil compaction and pollution</li>
                <li>Conflicts with urban infrastructure (e.g., utility lines)</li>
                <li>Budget constraints for maintenance and new plantings</li>
                <li>Climate change impacts on tree health and species selection</li>
                <li>Balancing development needs with forest conservation</li>

            <h2>Case Studies and Examples</h2>
            <h3>New York City's Million Trees Initiative</h3>
            <p>Launched in 2007, this program aimed to plant and care for one million new trees across New York City's five boroughs. The initiative was completed in 2015, two years ahead of schedule, significantly increasing the city's urban forest.</p>
            
            <h3>Singapore: The Garden City</h3>
            <p>Singapore has transformed itself from a concrete jungle to a garden city through extensive urban forestry programs. The city-state boasts over 300 km of green corridors and aims to have 85% of residents living within 400 meters of a park by 2030.</p>
