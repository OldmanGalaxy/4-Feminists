                <h2>Key Principles of SFM</h2>
                <p>Sustainable Forest Management is guided by several core principles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Ensuring that forest resources are managed to meet current needs without compromising future generations' ability to meet their own needs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Biodiversity Conservation:</strong> Maintaining the diversity of flora and fauna within forest ecosystems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ecosystem Approach:</strong> Managing forests as complex ecosystems rather than just as a source of timber.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multiple Use:</strong> Balancing various forest uses, including timber production, recreation, and ecosystem services.</li>
                    <li><strong>Participation:</strong> Involving local communities and stakeholders in forest management decisions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> Regularly assessing and improving management practices based on scientific research and monitoring.</li>
